# BinarySearchTree-Operations
This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C, allowing for basic operations such as insertion, deletion, searching for nodes, and finding the nth smallest element. The program interacts with the user through a console interface and can read initial values from an external text file to build the tree.
